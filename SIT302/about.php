">We aim to provide healthy diet on an affordable price to everyone. </h2>
		<p style="color:#ffffff; padding: 0px 18px;">What we eat and how much we eat influences our risk for disease and death.<br></p>
		<p style="color:#ffffff; padding: 0px 18px; text-align: justify;"> Poor diet is a leading cause of disease burden in Australia and 
		globally. The price of foods and beverages is a critical driver of food choice, particularly among individuals with limited food budgets. 
		Changing the price ratio between healthy and unhealthy foods is likely to be a critical leverage point for the improvement of population 
		health, as has been the case with tobacco and alcohol. But actions to rebalance the price of foods towards healthier options are currently 
		limited by a lack of understanding of the relative price and affordability of healthy and unhealthy foods and diets in Australia. Our aim 
		is to rigorously and systematically advance the evidence required for the uptake and successful implementation of effective and equitable
		healthy food pricing policies.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Our unit is one of the largest research groups dedicated to obesity prevention research in Australia.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		In the past decade we have expanded to include researchers across multiple disciplines, including nutrition and dietetics, epidemiology, political science and health economics. We have research teams working across the world to help advance the science of obesity prevention.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The GLOBE is led by Professor Steven Allender, Professor Boyd Swinburn, Professor Marj Moodie, Professor Colin Bell and Professor Anna Peeters. The team consists of academic researchers and students along with a broad range of external partners.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		GLOBE represents a large team that is committed to identifying, promoting and implementing obesity prevention and wellness strategies as a global, national and regional partner.</p>
