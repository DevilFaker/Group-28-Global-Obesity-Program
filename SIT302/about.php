">We aim to provide healthy diet on an affordable price to everyone. </h2>
		<p style="color:#A9B3CE; padding: 0px 18px;">What we eat and how much we eat influences our risk for disease and death.<br></p>
		<p style="color:#A9B3CE; padding: 0px 18px; text-align: justify;"> Poor diet is a leading cause of disease burden in Australia and 
		globally. The price of foods and beverages is a critical driver of food choice, particularly among individuals with limited food budgets. 
		Changing the price ratio between healthy and unhealthy foods is likely to be a critical leverage point for the improvement of population 
		health, as has been the case with tobacco and alcohol. But actions to rebalance the price of foods towards healthier options are currently 
		limited by a lack of understanding of the relative price and affordability of healthy and unhealthy foods and diets in Australia. Our aim 
		is to rigorously and systematically advance the evidence required for the uptake and successful implementation of effective and equitable
		healthy food pricing policies.</p>
